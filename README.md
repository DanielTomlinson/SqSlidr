README: SqSlidr
---------------

SqSlidr is yet another jQuery Slider, and is based upon Square's beautiful slider, it is rather customisable, with most effects being coded in CSS3, but don't worry, it still works in most older browsers, just without the fancy transitions.


_USAGE_

Check the demo! It's as simple as adding the new div's, and adding a line in the css for the slide, if you need more help, just send me an e-mail Daniel@ShadowDevelopments.co.uk
